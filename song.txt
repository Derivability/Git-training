I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I’d much rather be original

Le-le-le-le-le-let’s show them how we do this
Le-le-le-le-le-let’s start the show
I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I’d much rather be original

First off I’m thankful for everyone that follows me
And everyone that doubted me can swallow their apology
I’m the kind of character that’s written in mythology
Living in the present day it’s in my biology
To rap about equality and the rock mic properly
It’s obvious a lot of you could learn from this philosophy
I’m not a know-it-all I’m full of curiosity
I’m fascinated by the stars and their luminosity
Guided by a prophecy working at full velocity
I grew up the classics class of Sean Connery
My women’s from a James Bond flick I won the lottery
Plus I mold young minds similar to pottery
I just stole your fans better call it in a robbery
I sound so original my clone couldn't copy me
Honestly in my mind nobody is topping me

I don’t want to blend in how those other men did
Before they even got going their careers ended
But not me I’m driven by a very different engine
That keeps ripping giving me incredible momentum
So if you’re offended by anything I mention
Or anything I wear if you have an objection
Write out a complaint and place in your rectum
Or better yet type it in the comment section
That’ll give this video a little more attention
My God your iPod needs an intervention
Look at you doing that just because your friend did
Be yourself and make your decisions independent
My rhythm is tremendous and lyricism endless
Nobody is similar I see no resemblance
A treat for the senses followed by a question
Tell me, what is it you see in your reflection

I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I’d much rather be original

Imma be the only person I’m supposed to be
And that’s me it’s a bonus if they notice me
I make music and use it to buy my groceries
Nowadays I’m even moving units overseas
I’m busy working while they leave it to a clover leaf
I started locally and now they know me globally
Depression and anxiety I talk about them openly

Le-le-le-le-le-let’s show them how we do this
Le-le-le-le-le-let’s start the show
I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I’d much rather be original

I don’t want to be how everybody else is
