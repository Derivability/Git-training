I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I’d much rather be original

Le-le-le-le-le-let’s show them how we do this
Le-le-le-le-le-let’s start the show
I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I’d much rather be original
Le-le-le-le-le-let’s show them how we do this
Le-le-le-le-le-let’s start the show
I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I’d much rather be original

First off I’m thankful for everyone that follows me
And everyone that doubted me can swallow their apology
I’m the kind of character that’s written in mythology
Living in the present day it’s in my biology
To rap about equality and the rock mic properly
It’s obvious a lot of you could learn from this philosophy
I’m not a know-it-all I’m full of curiosity
I’m fascinated by the stars and their luminosity
Guided by a prophecy working at full velocity
I grew up the classics class of Sean Connery
My women’s from a James Bond flick I won the lottery
Plus I mold young minds similar to pottery
I just stole your fans better call it in a robbery
I sound so original my clone couldn't copy me
Honestly in my mind nobody is topping me

Le-le-le-le-le-let’s show them how we do this
Le-le-le-le-le-let’s start the show
I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I’d much rather be original
Le-le-le-le-le-let’s show them how we do this
Le-le-le-le-le-let’s start the show
I don’t want to be how everybody else is
I’d much rather be original

I don’t want to blend in how those other men did
Before they even got going their careers ended
But not me I’m driven by a very different engine
That keeps ripping giving me incredible momentum
So if you’re offended by anything I mention
